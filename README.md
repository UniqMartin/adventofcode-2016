# Advent of Code 2016

Martin's solutions for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) 2016.

## Usage

To run individual solutions, where `NN` is the zero-padded number of the day:

- Python: `python3 day-NN/main.py`

All output is standardized to look something like this:

```
Part One: <solution for part one>
Part Two: <solution for part two>
```

## Notes

- Output obviously depends on the user-specific input. This input is either in a file named `input.txt` or somewhere at the top of the main code file.
- Python code was tested with Python 3.5.2.

## License

Code is under the [BSD 2 Clause (NetBSD) license](LICENSE.txt).
